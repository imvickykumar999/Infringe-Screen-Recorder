# Screen Recorder

        Someone from Maharashtra mistakenly / intentionally 
        downloaded and run my key_logger.exe, and I got secrets.

# Why do I need to ignore files in [.gitignore?](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Screen-Recorder/blob/main/.gitignore)

- The files contain sensitive data.
- Security and API keys/secrets

        For security, the security key files and
        API keys should get added to the gitignore.
        (That is, if theyâ€™re even stored in the directory).

        Every commit is recorded in the history of a GitHub repo.
        If a key is submitted,
        even if it is taken down immediately after,
        a record of the key exists in that commit.
